  I received my B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science in 2013, 2015, and 2025, respectively, from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea. 
  My current research interests include 5G/6G wireless communications and networks, the Internet of Things (IoT), handover control, the integration of machine learning with wireless networks, and cell-free networks.
